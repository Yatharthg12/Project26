Measure out your ingredients. For this recipe, you’ll need 1 cup (100 g) of cocoa powder, 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of coconut oil, 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of honey, and 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract. Use a series of measuring cups to portion out each ingredient in a small cup or bowl.[1]
Measuring your ingredients in advance will make the cooking process more efficient once it comes time to put it all together.
If you like, you can also add ¼ cup (25 g) of confectioner’s sugar, 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) of agave syrup, or 3-6 drops of liquid stevia to lend a little more sweetness to your chocolate.

Melt 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of coconut oil in a small pot over low heat. Turn on your cooktop to the lowest heat setting and add the coconut oil to the pot. Allow it to melt completely. Coconut oil has a low melting point, so this should only take a few seconds.
Keeping the coconut oil moving continuously at the bottom of the pot will help it liquefy faster.

Add 4 tbsp (59 mL) of honey and ½ tbsp (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract. Use a whisk or metal spoon to scrape the sticky honey into the pot. Then, drizzle in the vanilla. Stir the ingredients into the melted oil until they dissolve and form a thin, syrupy mixture.
Be sure to keep your cooktop on a low heat setting. If the oil gets too hot, it could scorch the sugars in the honey and spoil the flavor of the finished chocolate.
If you wish to add any other sweeteners, such as confectioner’s sugar or stevia, do it at the same time that you add the honey and vanilla.

Sift in 1 cup (100 g) of cocoa powder gradually. Rather than dumping all of the cocoa powder in at once, add it a little at a time. As you do, keep your whisk or spoon moving to help distribute the cocoa powder evenly throughout the mixture.
You’ll have an easier time mixing the cocoa into your other ingredients with a whisk than you would with a spoon or spatula.

Take the chocolate off of the heat and continue stirring it as it thickens. You’ll know your chocolate is done when the chocolate takes on a smooth, dark color and the surface becomes slightly glossy. At this point, it just needs to be left to harden.
Removing the pot from the hot cooktop will prevent the chocolate from burning
